# @startup-docs/client

This repository contains the documentation for the [Startup Engine](https://github.com/orgs/startup-bootstrap-engine/repositories), which aims to be a collection of services and tools to bootstrap a startup business.

Run `yarn docs` in the root of the project to start our documentation server locally.

The documentation is written in Markdown and uses Docusaurus as a static site generator.
